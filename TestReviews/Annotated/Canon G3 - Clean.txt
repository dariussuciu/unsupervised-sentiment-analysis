I %%%recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am $$$extremely ###satisfied with the purchase. 
The camera is $$$very ###easy to use, in fact on a ^^^recent trip this past week, I was asked to take a picture of a vacationing ###elderly group. 
After i took their picture with their camera , they offered to take a picture of us. 
I just told them, press halfway, wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way. 
They fired away and the picture turned out $$$quite ###nicely. ( as all of my pictures have thusfar ) . 
A few of my work constituents owned the g2 and $$$highly %%%recommended the canon for picture quality . 
I'm ###easily enlarging pictures to 8 1/2 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the ###best possible setting as yet ( ###super fine ) . 
Ensure you get a ###larger flash , 128 or 256, some are selling with the ###larger flash , 32mb will do in a pinch but you'll quickly want a ###larger flash card as with any 4mp cameras. 
Bottom line, ###well made camera, ###easy to use, $$$very ###flexible and ###powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices . 
I'd $$$highly %%%recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for $$$excellent ###quality pictures and a combination of ###ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with ###many options to adjust if you %%%like . 
###great job canon! 
Yep.
This is my first digital camera , and what a ' toy ' it is ! 
I am a software engineer and am $$$very %%%keen into technical details of everything i buy, I spent around 3 months before buying the digital camera; and i must say , g3 worth every single cent i spent on it . 
Just a ###little overview, powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its a slr-like camera, its 4 megapixel and ( almost ) ###full manual control gives the pictures a %%%touch of ###brilliance . 
whether you are a novice or an expert , its ###ease of use and ###functionality goes together . 
You can have different kind of lens if you want + flashes , etc. 
As its 4mp, you might need ###bigger storage to store $$$high ###quality images and recording movies ( you can record 3 minutes of video ) . 
I am using kingston 512mb cf which works ###great and is $$$very ###fast . 
A ###good choice could be cf type ii , microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images . 
Some things that i did $$$not %%%like ( but hey . nothing is ###perfect ). 
* main dial is $$$not ###backlit . 
* lens visible in optical viewfinder . 
( well that's only for ###old-school ###die-hard optical viewfinder fans ) use LCD instead which is ###brilliant and you can twist around too . 
Overall I'm ###happy with my toy . 
I did ###extensive research comparing different 4 and 5 megapixel cameras . 
A couple of online camera review sites were $$$extremely ###helpful, as they provided ###complete ###exhaustive reviews of nearly every camera made , plus provided a ###great number of ###high resolution sample images to compare amongst the models . 
following my research , i decided on the g3 . 
in a word , " awesome " is how i would describe this camera . 
i won't go into the details here , as the online sites go into ###great depth in their reviews, but I am $$$very ###pleased with the features , the speed , the picture quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this camera offers . 
With the automatic settings , I really have $$$not taken a ###bad picture yet . 
And with the panoramic " stitch " mode , it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a ###seamless panoramic image . 
I am $$$absolutely in ###awe of this camera , canon put $$$enormous ###quality into the g3 . 
Do not walk , run and buy this camera if you have the budget , i guarantee you will $$$not be ###disappointed . 
I bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am $$$very ###satisfied . 
I have taken hundreds of photos with it and I continue to be ###amazed by their quality . 
The g3 is loaded with $$$many ###useful features , and unlike $$$many ###smaller digital cameras , it is ###easy to hold steady when using ###slower shutter speeds . 
flaws ? 
the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me . 
Still I am a $$$little ###surprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera . 
despite this ###minor disappointment , I $$$highly %%%recommend the canon g3 to anyone who is serious about digital photography . 
I only had this camera for one full day and I have to say that it is ###wonderful . 
The photo quality is ###amazing and I know I'm going to have fun with all the features . 
I've figured out most of its features on my own already ( because i have used digital cameras before , so i know things like symbols ) . 
I'm one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so I've been having trouble paying attention to the ###little display panel on top , but that does not stop me from %%%loving this camera . 
The reason I rated it a four is because of that ###darn diopter adjustment dial. its $$$very ###small and ###hard to turn so you can 't get an ###accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . ) 
I am going to have so $$$much ###fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a $$$more ###accurate review . 
positives 
slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide ###excellent photos if you do not want to bother with the settings . 
###excellent range of metering options as well . 
it 's ###great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen . 
4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi-serious amateur photographer ) 
4x zoom is ###nice 
the ###great thing about digital , in general , is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture , not two weeks later when you get the film developed . 
its focusing system is also $$$very ###flexible . 
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be $$$really ###helpful if shooting a scene that is ###tough to automatically focus . 
negatives 
$$$quite ###bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr ) and uses a ###heavy battery , although $$$not $$$very ###solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line ) 
$$$not $$$very ###ergonomic - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens ) 
The viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying . 
The camera has a ###wonderful set of features . 
The lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for ###easy pictures . 
You can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd . 
The optical zoom works ###great and the 14x digital zoom is a $$$very ###nice addition although pictures at the ###highest digital zoom are a $$$little ###blurry . 
The ###highest optical zoom pictures are ###perfect . 
I have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am $$$very ###pleased . 
The canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is $$$very ###nice and $$$very ###easy to use . 
the only two ###minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is $$$not $$$very ###snug and can co	me off $$$too ###easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) . 
the menus are ###easy to navigate and the buttons are ###easy to use . 
it is a ###fantastic camera and $$$well ###worth the price . 
recent price drops have made the g3 the ###best bargain in digital cameras currently available . 
###advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable . 
newbies will find the full auto setting will give them ###perfect pictures right out of the box . 
4 megapixels is ###enough for anybody and the photo quality is ###awesome . 
do not get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype . 
unless you want to print murals , you do not need it . 
those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 $$$very ###comfortable and ###friendly to use . 
anyone looking for more than " point and shoot " can make a ###huge step up for a ###moderate price difference . 
the extended zoom range and ###faster lens put it at the top of it 's class . 
i expect the g3 will %%%please me for years to come . 
i %%%recommend $$$unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a ###first-class digital camera at a ###reasonable price - there is $$$no ###better camera out there - period ! 
it gives ###great pictures , the controls are ###easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is $$$very ###user-friendly and it is ###beautiful in it chrome casing . 
i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am ###amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode . 
$$$absolutely ###breathtaking . 
i was considering the olympus camedia c-5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out . 
the olympus is a $$$bit ###clumsy-looking and the user-interface %%%not as ###friendly as the canon , but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life - no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3 . 
i would %%%recommend a ###larger compact-flash card , at least 128 mb . 
i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works ###great with my canon . 
what else can you say about a camera that works for both of you ? 
i make photographs at work , and so wanted a camera ###good enough to compare with what i use professionally . 
at the same time , i wanted my wife to $$$not be ###intimidated by knobs and buttons . 
i received the camera , inserted a ###larger card , charged the battery , and handed it to my wife . 
i showed her how to turn it on , where the lens zoom lever is , and she %%%loves it ! 
this camera has canon 's ###great colorimetry , plus what you see in the lcd is what you get . 
the prints are ###beautiful ! 
and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at ###highest quality . 
i tried out some other brands in the stores , and was ###disappointed by the battery life of the other company ; plus what you see in the lcd ( no optical finder ) is n't what you get - not even for color ; the output was ###less than i expected . 
although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a $$$really ###long time , recharge $$$fairly ###quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a ###knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon . 
this is a ###great camera for you !
